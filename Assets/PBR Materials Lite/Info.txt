Thanks for downloading! I hope you find useful.

If you like these materials i have a package with more than 40 realistic materials, and i planing to add more. So check it out before the price raise.

Note: I released these materials in version 2017.1.0f3, but some textures like 'Roughness', 'Ambient Occlusion', and 'Height' only work in newer versions.

If have any problems, doubts, or suggestions, please let me know.
